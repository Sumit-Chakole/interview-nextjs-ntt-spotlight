# Helpful Tips

- **Increase Editor/Terminal Font Size**:

  1. Click the settings icon in the editor.
  2. Go to _User Settings_.
  3. Search for `fontSize`.
  4. Set to `16` for better readability.

- **Preview in seperate tab**:

  - Open the preview in a separate browser tab (via the arrow button on the top-right of the preview window) for a full-screen experience.
  - Any change in code would trigger auto reload in preview tab

- **Inspect Your Work**:

  - You may use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect your **own preview output**, just as you would with any other web project.
